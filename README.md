# Welcome to the 42 duckhunt

To find the ducks, you have to fix the flags.
Each flag will lead you to one duck.

Fix the flag, grab the duck from underneath the keyboard of the taget workstation and bring it to Front Desk.

- If the duck is gone, another team was faster.
- Only fix what is necessary
- Have Fun!

After the ages of rotten milk and memory leaks,
the city dwellers of Berlin had to face a new challenge.
Due to misaligned assignments, the city was divided into the land of the
droughtful east and the land of the depressed north.
Resources and places that once were in reach, seemed now so far away.
Segmentation faults on both sides occurred.

In this disrupted time, the young, but knowledgeable bear Fulgens
found themself in Berlin. Fulgens’ original order was to build a gate
that would outlast generations.
An almost Babylonical project to impress the world.
For Fulgens, it seemed too shallow to build a symbol just for the sake of
showing the world Berlin's greatness when the city itself is not doing well.
So Fulgens made it their mission and implemented modern technology in the tower.
By doing that Fulgens cleared the way for information exchange and
broke communication boundaries.
Over time this act of revolution restored the sense of belonging and
led to the unification of the eastern and northern parts of the city.
The tower became not just a symbol of greatness but of togetherness.

We honour Fulgen's beauty and usage of technology
that creates a better present and future.
